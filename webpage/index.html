				FMake is a Python script designed to automate the process of compiling programs with many modules. It can be used as an alternative to GNU Make or CMake. <p style="text-align: center"><b>FMake is free software. Use, reproduce and adapt it to your needs without restriction.</b></p>	
		</div>

			<!-- <b style="color: red"> WARNING: This project is not yet well developed. Documentation is insufficient and few tests have been done.</b> -->
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
			<p>
				FMake is simple and robust, there is nothing very special about it. It consists of the <b>fmake</b> directory script set.
			</p>

			<p>
				Basically, the <b>fmake/main.py</b> script has some trace functions for code files. In addition, the <b>fmake/targets</b> directory contains a set of plug-ins responsible for different compilation modes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The compilation process is described simply and clearly in a text file containing fmake settings. This file is not exactly a script, but it is a Python dictionary that will be parsed by an <b>eval()</b>.
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="section">
			<h2>How to use</h2>
			
			<p>
				<h3>1 - Add the fmake directory to the project root</h3>
				This directory contains the fmake scripts.				
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>2 - Create a FMake config text file in the project root</h3>
				The contents of this file must be a python dictionary with the compilation process information. This file will be further explained in the documentation.			
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>3 - Create a build.py script in the project root</h3>
				This script file must call the <b>make</b> function from the <b>fmake/main.py</b> module (specifying the project root path, <b>fmake</b> directory path, and settings file path).
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>4 - Are native targets enough?</h3>
				You may need to create your own target script.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Operation</h2>

			<p>
				The fmake/main.py script contains the <b>make</b> function. This function must be called by a build.py script to start the build process.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the first things that happens when make is invoked is the loading of target-modules into the target directory. This operation is performed by the <b>load_targets</b> function.
			</p>

			<p>
				Immediately afterwards, the configurations file is loaded and parsed by the <b>eval</b> function.
			</p>

			<p>
				If there are no syntax errors in the configurations file, the step-by-step compilation will start.
			</p>

			<h3>Configurations file</h3>

			<p>
				The configurations file is a text file that contains a python dictionary with the compilation process information.
			</p>

			<p>
				The configuration file must contain:
				<ul>
					<li>A "magic" tag with the value "fmakeconfig".</li>
					<li>A "steps" tag with a list containing the tags of the compilation steps in the order in which they should be performed.</li>
					<li>Arbitrary tags (can be strings or numbers) containing the information of the compilation steps. Each must contain a sub-dictionary with the build target settings.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Targets and target-modules</h2>

			<p>
				Target-modules are small plug-ins that perform the most important part of the compilation process. For each build step described in the fmake configuration file, a target is specified and a target-module is used.
